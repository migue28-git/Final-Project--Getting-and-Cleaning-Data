# Final-Project--Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
----------------------------------------------------
This project is about simplifying a data set taked from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and making it a tidy data set. You can see the the meaning of each variable and how the information was collected in the "UCI HAR Dataset" file.

All the project is based in a principal script that is "run_analysis.R" which is thecode writted in R of how the tidy dataset was made. Other scripts are:

1.- tidy data set.txt : is the final data set which have the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2.-Code Book.md :  a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to                       clean up the data.
